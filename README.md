Welcome to *Programming with Spaces*!

pSpaces is international collaboration project lead by the Technical University of Denmark and the University of Camerino  project that aims at providing a simple yet powerful support for programming distributed applications with (tuple) spaces. The current support includes libraries for mainstream languages such as Java, C#, Go, JavaScript and Swift. Different classes of tuple spaces are supported. These include standard message channels to support traditional message-passing and actor-like programming, spaces with random tuple retrieval to support probabilistic programming, and Linda-like tuple spaces alike the Java libraries Klava and jRESP. 

This repository contains information for programmers and developers, including:
- [Hello world!](hello.md) - your first program with spaces
- [A tutorial](tutorial.md) - how to program with spaces 
- [A guide for developers](guide.md) - how to integrate support for a new language.
- [The formal semantics](semantics.md) - a precise description of the programming model. 
- [Spaces in Promela](Promela/promela.md) - how to use the Spin model checker to model and verify pSpace applications.

pSpaces is work in progress: current work includes interoperability between applications written in different languages, support for additional mainstream languages like Python, secure communications, encryption, access control and privacy protection.
