This tutorial provides a gentle introduction to programming with spaces. We mostly use the Go implemenation of spaces ([goSpace](https://github.com/pSpaces/goSpace)) in the code examples due to the succint syntax of Go, but most explanations are generic and can be easily adapted to other programming languages.

*NOTE: this is work in progress.*

The chapters of the tutorial are:
1. [Programming with Spaces](tutorial-tuple-spaces.md)
2. [Concurrent Programming with Spaces](tutorial-concurrent-programming.md)
3. [Distributed Programming with Spaces](tutorial-distributed-programming.md) *-work in progress-*

Coming soon chapters on message-passing, data-oriented spaces, and security.
